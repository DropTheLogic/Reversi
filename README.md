### How to Play
The general rules of Reversi can be found on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi). Two players take turns capturing each other's pieces, reversing the piece from the opponent's to the player's piece, until the board is filled up or no moves are available. The player with the most pieces is the winner. To play, simply click the space of the board for the move you wish to make.
